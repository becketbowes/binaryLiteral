  ## OVERVIEW:
   technology and culture blog. This is an interactive website to showcase the events in my community in a style that has more flavor than generic social media. Social media doesn't have the personality inherent to, say, counter culture 'zines that i grew up with. This is an attempt to bring some of that 'zine flavor to a digital forum.
